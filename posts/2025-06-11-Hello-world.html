        <p>hey!!</p>
        <p>
            just finished configuring this site, hopefully won't have to do much maintenance now..<br>
            i'll mainly post about stuff i like and some projects i start, as well as some art.
        </p>
        <p>so, uh, this one will be kinda short as it's mostly introductory. 
            i think it'll take a little while for me to get a hang of this whole blogging thing, 
            but i'll get there eventually :]</p>
        <p>bye for now</p>
